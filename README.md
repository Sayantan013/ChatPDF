## Purpose

Reading a 50 page PDF before an exam is hard. ChatPDF replaces the tediousness of skimming/cramming/glancing through a PDF and automates with the new buzz around the block - AI. This ease the burden on students, researches, and other professionals significantly.

## Features I want to include/use

- [x] A nice UI for PDF upload and chat using shadcn/ui and Tailwind.
- [x] Authentication/Authorisation using Clerk.
- [x] Neon/Serverless and the new DrizzleORM for database needs.
- [x] File upload and storage using react-dropzone and AWS S3 buckets.
- [] A Vector database preferrably PineConeDB to store complex data.
- [] React query for all our data-fetching needs.
- [] Vercel's AI SDK to converse with our PDF.

> Optional:
- [] Stripe Integration
